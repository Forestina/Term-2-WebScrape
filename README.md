 ——————INTRODUCTION OF THIS PROJECT——————
This code is used for scraping the information related to "governance" in /Government by algorithm/ Wikipedia.
The entry is a specify introduction of Algorithm including Justice, AI, Prevention and so on. It is lots of information.
But the key point is "blockchain governance". So I just need to search "blockchain" in this whole passage.
Then I get 5 information about "blockchain governance", which is what I needed. This information will be used for my theoratical basement of my project in Computational Arts-Based Research and Theory.
