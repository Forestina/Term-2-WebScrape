      "government by algorithm&#91;1&#93; (also known as algorithmic regulation,&#91;2&#93;regulation by algorithms, algorithmic governance,&#91;3&#93;algocratic governance, algorithmic legal order or algocracy&#91;4&#93;) is an alternative form of government or social ordering, where the usage of computer algorithms, especially of artificial intelligence and blockchain, is applied to regulations, law enforcement, and generally any aspect of everyday life such as transportation or land registration.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93; the term 'government by algorithm' appeared in academic literature as an alternative for 'algorithmic governance' in 2013.&#91;10&#93; a related term, algorithmic regulation is defined as setting the standard, monitoring and modifying behaviour by means of computational algorithms — automation of judiciary is in its scope.&#91;11&#93; in the context of blockchain, it is also known as blockchain governance.&#91;12&#93;",
      "in 2017, ukraine's ministry of justice ran experimental government auctions using blockchain technology to ensure transparency and hinder corruption in governmental transactions.&#91;38&#93; \"government by algorithm?\" was the central theme introduced at data for policy 2017 conference held on 6-7 september 2017 in london, uk.&#91;39&#93;",
      "a smart city is an urban area where collected surveillance data is used to improve various operations. increase in computational power allows more automated decision making and replacement of public agencies by algorithmic governance.&#91;40&#93; in particular, the combined use of artificial intelligence and blockchains for iot may lead to the creation of sustainable smart city ecosystems.&#91;41&#93;intelligent street lighting in glasgow is an example of successful government application of ai algorithms.&#91;42&#93; a study of smart city initiatives in the us shows that it requires public sector as a main organizer and coordinator, the private sector as a technology and infrastructure provider, and universities as expertise contributors.&#91;43&#93;",
      "the cryptocurrency millionaire jeffrey berns proposed the operation of local governments in nevada by tech firms in 2021.&#91;44&#93; berns bought 67,000 acres (271 km²) in nevada's rural storey county (population 4,104) for $170,000,000 (£121,000,000) in 2018 in order to develop a smart city with more than 36,000 residents that could generate an annual output of $4,600,000,000.&#91;44&#93; cryptocurrency will be allowed for payments.&#91;44&#93; blockchains, inc. \"innovation zone\" was canceled in september 2021 after it failed to secure enough water&#91;45&#93; for the planned 36,000 residents, through water imports from a site located 100 miles away in the neighboring washoe county.&#91;46&#93; similar water pipeline proposed in 2007 was estimated to cost $100 million and to would have taken about 10 years to develop.&#91;47&#93; with additional water rights purchased from tahoe reno industrial general improvement district, \"innovation zone\" would have acquired enough water for about 15,400 homes - meaning that it would have barely covered its planned 15,000 dwelling units, leaving nothing for the rest of the projected city and its 22 million square-feet of industrial development.&#91;48&#93;",
      "smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized autonomous organization are mentioned as means to replace traditional ways of governance.&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93;&#91;9&#93; cryptocurrencies are currencies, which are enabled by algorithms without a governmental central bank.&#91;57&#93;central bank digital currency often employs similar technology, but is differentiated from the fact that it does use a central bank. it is soon to be employed by major unions and governments such as the european union and china. smart contracts are self-executable contracts, whose objectives are the reduction of need in trusted governmental intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs.&#91;58&#93;&#91;59&#93; a decentralized autonomous organization is an organization represented by smart contracts that is transparent, controlled by shareholders and not influenced by a central government.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93; smart contracts have been discussed for use in such applications as use in (temporary) employment contracts&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93; and automatic transfership of funds and property (i.e. inheritance, upon registration of a death certificate).&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93; some countries such as georgia and sweden have already launched blockchain programs focusing on property (land titles and real estate ownership)&#91;38&#93;&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93; ukraine is also looking at other areas too such as state registers.&#91;38&#93;"
